Site 1 consists of approximately 442 acres at the southeast corner of 40th Street East and Avenue K and Site consists of approximately 896 acres bound by 50th Street East, 70th Street East, Avenue J, and Avenue K. Most of the property would be developed with solar facilities with the hydrogen production component of the project located along 70th Street East just north of Avenue K. Little Rock Wash runs through the project site around 60th Street East. No activities would occur within the wash or a 100-foot buffer on either side of the wash. 
The facility would be a self-sufficient, integrated, off-grid renewable energy facility comprised of the following:
•	A 650-megawatt (MW) ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) solar generating facility;
•	330-megawatt-hour (MWh) battery long duration energy storage (LDES) system;
•	A green hydrogen production plant incorporating 400 MWe of electrolyzers and liquefied and gaseous hydrogen storage;
•	Up to two horizontal cylindrical tanks with a capacity of 30 metric tons each;
•	Up to three spherical liquefied hydrogen tanks with a capacity of 100 metric tons each;
•	Onside gaseous hydrogen storage of 30 metric tons in a linear surface pipe storage arrangement;
•	Facilities for filing liquid and gaseous hydrogen transport trailers for shipping;
•	Facilities for fueling zero emission trucks/vehicles with gaseous hydrogen;
•	2 control/office buildings and 2 warehouse/service buildings; and
•	Cooling towers. The specific number of cooling towers is dependent on the total number of hydrogen production “trains”.
In addition to these facilities, the project site would be surrounded by a tubular steel or chain link fence and 10’ of landscaping would be provided between the edge of the public roadways and the fence to provide additional screening. This screening would occur along Avenue K, Avenue L, 40th Street East, 50th Street East, and 70th Street East along the project frontage. Landscaping would also be provided within the employee parking areas of the site but would not occur around the hydrogen production or fueling areas for safety reasons.

The Project will be comprised of battery modules installed in racks housed in purpose-built outdoor Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) enclosures, associated equipment, a project substation, and a generation tie-line (gen-tie) connecting the Project to the adjacent existing Southern California Edison (SCE) Antelope Substation. Specifically, the Project consists of the following components: battery enclosures, power conversion system (PCS), medium voltage transformers, outdoor electrical equipment, project substation, power distribution center, gen-tie line, fire and thermal runway safety equipment, and operations & maintenance (O&M) office and storage enclosures. The Project is located within the California Independent Service Operator (CAISO) Big Creek/Ventura Local Capacity Resource Area and will be charged from the CAISO grid via the Project’s interconnection to the Antelope Substation. Energy stored in the Project will then be discharged into the grid when the energy is needed, providing important electrical reliability services to the local area.
The Project will be monitored and operated remotely 24 hours per day, 7 days per week from an off-site control center with no permanent on-site operations and maintenance personnel. The Project will include a small office and storage structure equipped with restroom facilities for temporary operations and maintenance (O&M) personnel use. Operating staff, typically in crews of two to four staff members, will visit the site bi-weekly and as needed for project maintenance. The site will be fully fenced and will not be open to the public. The Project includes other design features including access roads, security fencing and lighting. A drainage basin will be installed to retain stormwater on-site.

This subdivision was approved by the City of Lancaster Planning Commission on December 18, 2017. With approval of the subdivision, all discretionary actions for the City were completed and remain valid; no other discretionary approvals are necessary.

The layout of the subdivision is not changing and will still result in the creation of 84 single family residential lots with a minimum lot size of 7,000 square feet. However, in accordance with what is allowable under State law, the developer will be constructing a total of 199 units on the 84 lots. These dwelling units will consist of the primary residence on each lot along with an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) and Junior Accessory Dwelling Unit (JADU). Within each lot, primary homes, ADUs and JADUs will be separated by a six foot vinyl fence and linked together via a network of walking paths and trails. The perimeter of the subdivision will be enclosed by a six foot block wall. The development will also provide community amenities including a community building (lounge, office spaces, fitness center), park (pool/spa, bbq area), and parking area for the community amenities. The inclusion of ADUs and JADUs on each lot are allowed by right and do not require a discretionary approval.

Subsequent to the approval of the subdivision, the California Fish and Game Commission listed the Joshua tree as a candidate species under the California Endangered Species Act. While in its candidacy period, Joshua trees are afforded the same protections they would receive as a listed species. Joshua trees were identified in the original Initial Study; however, potential impacts to Joshua trees were not analyzed to the level necessary for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to issue an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) as it was not a candidate/listed species in 2017. 

To streamline the ITP process, the City of Lancaster has agreed to revise the Initial Study to specifically address impacts to the Joshua tree from the proposed project and identify adequate mitigation measures. The initial study has been revised to address these impacts and to update the format to the latest version found in the CEQA Guidelines. No new mitigation measures, with the exception of those necessary for the Joshua tree, have been added nor have any substantive revisions to the original mitigation measures been made.
